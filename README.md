# NN-for_predicting-continuous-values

There is a regression task with multiple continuous outputs.

The task has been solved with 3 approaches: CNN with using the data generators, 
                                            Sequential DNN model and 
                                            Multiple output model with functional keras API.

The problem formalization and the first approach are here https://github.com/NataliiaMatsiuk/NN-for-predicting-continuous-values/blob/main/Problem_formalization_and_CNN_based_solution.ipynb

The output is in the csv-file https://github.com/NataliiaMatsiuk/NN-for-predicting-continuous-values/blob/main/output_CNN.csv

The second approach (Sequential DNN model) is here https://github.com/NataliiaMatsiuk/NN-for-predicting-continuous-values/blob/main/Sequential_model.ipynb

The output is in the csv-file https://github.com/NataliiaMatsiuk/NN-for-predicting-continuous-values/blob/main/output_Sequential_model.csv

The third approach (Multiple output model with functional keras API)  is here https://github.com/NataliiaMatsiuk/NN-for-predicting-continuous-values/blob/main/Multioutput_model_Functional_API.ipynb
